# Nextflow Pipeline for DeepTrio

This repository contains a Nextflow pipeline for Googleâ€™s DeepTrio, optimised for execution on NCI Gadi.

## Quickstart Guide

1. Edit the `pipeline_params.yml` file to include:
    - `samples`:  a list of family trio entries, where each entry includes a unique family id, child sample name, child BAM file path, parent1 sample name, parent1 BAM file path, parent2 sample name, parent2 BAM path, path to an optional regions-of-interest BED file (set to `''` if not required), and the model type. For BAM files, ensure corresponding .bai is in the same directory.
    - `ref`: path to the reference FASTA (ensure corresponding .fai is in the same directory).
    - `output_dir`: directory path to save output files.
    - `nci_project`, `nci_storage` : NCI project and storage.

2. Update `nextflow.config` to match the resource requirements for each stage of the pipeline. For NCI Gadi, you may need to adjust only `time` and `disk` (i.e. jobfs) parameters based on the size of the datasets used (the default values are tested to be suitable for a PacBio dataset with each family member's BAM being ~45GB in size).

3. Load the Nextflow module and run the pipeline using the following commands:
    ```bash
    module load nextflow/24.04.1
    nextflow run main.nf -params-file pipeline_params.yml
    ```

    Note: Additional Nextflow options can be included (e.g., `-resume` to resume from a previously paused/interrupted run)

4. For each family trio, output files will be stored in the directory `output_dir/family_id`.

## Notes  

1. It is assumed that the user has access to NCI's `if89` project (required for using DeepTrio via `module load`). If not, simply request access using this [link](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/if89).
